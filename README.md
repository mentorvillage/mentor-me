As an entrepreneur, whenever you need business advice, our volunteers are happy to help. By posting your questions, you can communicate directly and solve a problem. As an experience business owner you can help pay it forward just by installing the Be My Mentor app.

3.  Ability to easily create and post a question (including title, question, tagged business type, and optional photos/files)
4.  Ability to easily edit / delete a question
5.  Ability for anyone to easily search / find posted questions
6.  Ability to respond to a posted question via message
7.  Use a notification API like Twilio (https://www.twilio.com/) or Growl (http://growl.info/) to allow volunteers to be notified when a question is posted in their business type.

# Stretch:

Allow photos or files to be attached to a posted question. Allow an entrepreneur to request a call with a mentor for a fee.
